Name

	setprinter - configure and load default printers for users
	
Synopsis
	setprinter [-hvgcli]
	
Description

This Program was designed to make loading a default printer on a per user basis easier then using the registry hacks described by Microsoft
in Knowledge Base article 196732 (link:  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;196732).  The command line options are straight
forward has the don't require any arguments.

Options

	-h:  Displays Help
	
	-v:  Displays Version
	
	-g:  Generate key files (this program basically makes key file obsolete, but they were used to imlement the solution outlined in the Microsoft
		 knowledge base article above)
		 
	-c:  Configure default printers for users
	
	-l:  Load the configured default printer for the logged in user
	
	-i:  Generate an empty ini file (called setprinter.bak, if your setprinter.ini gets corrupted just copy the contents to this file under the first line
		 and rename it to setprinter.ini)
		 
Version History
V.002:  Upgrades!
		Fixes and Additions:
		
		-i functions now, creates setprinter.bak to be copied to setprinter.ini ( so if the settings are still in setprinter.ini they can be recovered)
		loads spooler settings from registry instead of from config file...no more KeyFile/Value mismatches
		added routines so you can configure a number of users in one run instead of having to run the program again and again
		added global default printer option
		
		TODO:
		
		Would like a better "reconfigure" technique, shouldn't have to edit the ini file by hand EVER if you don't want to.
		
V.001:	Inital Internal Release
		
		TODO:
		
		-i does not function yet
		Need to have the load function pull the port from the HKCU registry rather then the file so we don't get wandering NE numbers
